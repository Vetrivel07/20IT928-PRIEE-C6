## Problem Definition

* Productivity needs to be increased so that farmers can get more pay from the same piece of land without degrading soil.
* Indian farmers arenâ€™t able to choose the right crop based on their soil requirements depending upon factors like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, rainfall, pH.
* Develop an AI-based Fertilizer Recommendation System that provides precise and data-driven fertilizer recommendations to farmers based on the specific requirements of their crops and fields.
* This system should optimize nutrient utilization, increase crop yields, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the overall profitability of agricultural operations.
* According to a study by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, annual crop losses due to pests amount to Rs. 50,000 crore.
